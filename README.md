## What is Docker?

  Docker is a tool designed to allow you to build, deploy and run applications in an isolated and consistent manner across different machines and operating systems. This process is done using <strong>CONTAINERS</strong>. which are lightweight virtualized environments that package all the dependencies and code an application needs to run into a single text file, which can run the same way on any machine.
  
  While Docker is primarily used to package and run applications in containers, it is not limited to that use case. Docker can also be used to create and run other types of containers, such as ones for testing, development, or experimentation.

## What is a Docker Image?

  Docker Image is a lightweight executable package that includes everything the application needs to run, including the code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and dependencies.
  
  Although it cannot guarantee error-free performance, as the behavior of an application ultimately depends on many factors beyond the image itself, using Docker can reduce the likelihood of unexpected errors.
  
  Docker Image is built from a <strong>DOCKERFILE</strong>, which is a simple text file that contains a set of instructions for building the image, with each instruction creating a new layer in the image.

## What is a Dockerfile?

  Dockerfile is that <ins><i><strong>SIMPLE TEXT FILE</strong></i></ins> that I mentioned earlier, which contains a set of instructions for building a Docker Image. It specifies the base image to use and then includes a series of commands that automate the process for configuring and building the image, such as installing packages, copying files, and setting environment variables. Each command in the Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image.

## What is a Docker Compose?

  Docker Compose is a powerful tool that simplifies the deployment and management of multi-container Docker applications. It provides several benefits, including simplifying the process of defining related services, volumes for data persistence, and networks for connecting containers. With Docker Compose, you can easily configure each service's settings, including the image to use, the ports to expose, and the environment variables to set...

  Overall, Docker Compose streamlines the development process, making it easier for you to build and deliver your applications with greater efficiency and ease.
  
  A Docker Compose has 3 important parts, which are:
  
  * <strong>Services:</strong> A service is a unit of work in Docker Compose, it has a name, and it defines a container images, a set of environment variables, and a set of ports that are exposed to the host machine. When you run `docker-compose up`, Docker will create a new container for each service in your Compose file.

  * <strong>Networks:</strong> A network is a way for containers to communicate with each other. When you create a network in your Compose file, Docker will create a new network that all the other containers in your Compose file will be connected to. This allows containers to communicate with each other without even knowing the IP of each other, just by the name.

  * <strong>Volumes:</strong> A volume is a way to store data that is shared between containers. When you create a volume in your Compose file, Docker will create a new volume (a folder in another way) that all the containers have access to. This allows you to share data between the containers without having to copy-paste each and every time you want that data.

## What is a Container?

  A Container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## What is the difference between Container and VM?

  Containers and Virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of the hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient.
  
  * <ins><strong>Containers</strong></ins> are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (talks about tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications, and require fewer VMs and Operating Systems.

  </p>
  
  * <ins><strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong></ins> are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each machine includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries, and libraries. VMs take more space compared to containers (talking about tens of GBs in size), and they can be slow to boot.

## What is PID 1?

  In a Docker container, the PID 1 process is a special process that plays an important role in the container's lifecycle. This process is the identifier of the init process, which is the first process that is started when the system boots up, and it is responsible for starting and stoping all of the other processes on the system. And in Docker as well, the init process is responsible for starting and stoping the application that is running in the container.
      
   > PID 1 in a Docker container behaves differently from the init process in a normal Unix-based system. (they are NOT the same!)

## Is the Daemon process PID 1? And how does they differ from each other?

  <ins><strong>The daemon process is NOT the PID 1</strong></ins>, the daemon process is a background process that runs continuosuly on a system and performs a specific task. In contrast, PID 1 is the first process that the kernel starts in a Unix-based system and plays a special role in the system.

## What is WP-CLI?

  WP-CLI is the command line interface for WordPress. It is a tool that allows you to interact with your WordPress site from the command line, it is used for a lot of purposes, such as automating tasks, debugging problems, installing/removing plugins along side with themes, managing users and roles, exporting/importing data, run databses queries, and so much more...

## Why do you need to work with WP-CLI?

  Since its a tool that allows you to interact directly with your WordPress site from the terminal, it can save you a lot of time that will take you to (for example) installing a pluging/theme manually, moderate users and their roles, deploy a new WordPress website to a production server, etc...
  
  WP-CLI will help you do all that in less time and automated as well, so It's a really a great tool that will help you react with your WordPress website.
  
## What is Redis Cache? And why do you need it in WordPress?

  Redis Cache, or Redis Object Cache, is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as database, cache, or message brocker. It's a plugin for WordPress that improves the performance of your website by storing accessed data in memory, rather than querying the database each and every time that data is needed.
  
  You need Redis Cache plugin in your WordPress website because it can improve the performance of the website and reduce the time that it takes to load all the data from your databases, which will cause in a better user experience, plus it will help your website rank higher in search engines, etc...
